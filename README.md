The src folder contains the Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifer algorithms coded from scratch. 

The Decision Tree code lends heavily from this repo: https://github.com/random-forests/tutorials/blob/master/decision_tree.ipynb
I made a few modifications to the original code.

The jupyter notebook shows the implementation of both algorithms on the Titanic dataset.

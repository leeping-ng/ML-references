This is a machine learning classification problem, where the task is to predict whether passengers are survivors or non-survivors, based on other features such as age, ticket class, sex, etc.

The Jupyter Notebook includes the code and explanations of the choices I made to build the model. The model was able to achieve **81.7%** training accuracy and **78.1%** validation accuracy.

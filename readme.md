This is a machine learning classification problem, where the task is to predict whether passengers are survivors or non-survivors, based on other features such as age, ticket class, sex, etc.

The Jupyter Notebook includes the code and explanations of the choices I made to build the model.

After feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, the ROC-AUC score improved from the initial benchmark of 75.7% to **86.1%**.
